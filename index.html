      <h2>Tokyo</h2>
      <h5>The Capital of Japan</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg1" style="height:600px;"></div>
      <p>Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum).
        The old, narrow streets of the Asakusa district contain shops, women in kimono and the 7th-century Sensō-ji Buddhist temple. By contrast, Roppongi has lively nightclubs and karaoke bars, and Akihabara has high-tech electronics stores. Cozy Japanese-style pubs called izakaya are scattered throughout the city. The expansive Toyosu fish market is known for its morning tuna auction. The Tokyo SkyTree tower offers expansive views of the city from its public observation deck. Tokyo is famed for its vibrant food scene, and its Shibuya and Harajuku districts are the heart of its trendy teen fashion culture.</p>

      <h2>Things to do in japan</h2>
      <h5>While you are exploring the wonders of japan here are some places that you wanna visit:</h5>
      <h5>1.Tokyo SkyTree</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg2" style="height:205px;"></div>
      <p>Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリー Tōkyō Sukaitsurī) is a broadcasting and observation tower in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan. It became the tallest structure in Japan in 2010[3] and reached its full height of 634.0 metres (2,080 ft) in March 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower,[4][5] and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa (829.8 m/2,722 ft).[6]
       The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kantō region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012.[7] The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by the Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station. The complex is 7 km (4.3 mi) north-east of Tokyo Station.</p>
       <h5>2.Tokyo Tower</h5>
       <div class="fakeimg3" style="height:200px"></div>
      <p>Tokyo Tower (東京タワー Tōkyō tawā, officially called 日本電波塔 Nippon denpatō "Japan Radio Tower") is a communications and observation tower in the Shiba-koen district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. At 332.9 metres (1,092 ft), it is the second-tallest structure in Japan. The structure is an Eiffel Tower-inspired lattice tower that is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations.
       Built in 1958, the tower's main sources of income are tourism and antenna leasing. Over 150 million people have visited the tower. FootTown, a four-story building directly under the tower, houses museums, restaurants and shops. Departing from there, guests can visit two observation decks.</p>
       <h5>3. Meiji Shrine</h5>
       <div class="fakeimg4" style="height:200px"></div>
       <p>Meiji Shrine (明治神宮 Meiji Jingū), located in Shibuya, Tokyo, is the Shinto shrine that is dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken.The shrine does not contain the emperor's grave, which is located at Fushimi-momoyama, south of Kyoto.</p>
       <h5>4.Takeshita Street</h5>
       <div class="fakeimg5" style="height: 200px"></div>
       <p>Takeshita Street (竹下通り Takeshita-dōri) is a pedestrian shopping street lined with fashion boutiques, cafes and restaurants in Harajuku in Tokyo, Japan. Stores on Takeshita Street include major chains such as The Body Shop, McDonald's, and 7-Eleven, but most of the businesses are small independent shops that carry an array of styles. The shops on this street are often a bellwether for broader fads, and some are known as "antenna shops," which manufacturers seed with prototypes for test-marketing.
        Located directly across from the exit of JR East's Harajuku Station, Takeshita Street is very popular with young teenagers, particularly those visiting Tokyo on school trips, or local young people shopping for small "cute" goods at weekends.</p>
        <h5>5.Mount Takao</h5>
        <div class="fakeimg6" style="height: 200px"></div>
        <p>Mount Takao (高尾山 Takao-san) is a mountain in the city of Hachiōji, Tokyo, Japan. It is protected within Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park.
        Standing 599 metres (1,965 ft) tall and located within an hour of downtown Tokyo, it is a popular hiking spot, with eight hiking courses and more than 2.5 million annual visitors. The Tama Forest Science Garden is also located at the mountain's base.
         Mount Takao is closely associated with the Shinto-Buddhist tengu, minor kami from Japanese folklore, and the daitengu Naigubu. The mountain is also renowned for Shugendō, the mountain asceticism focusing on strict discipline. A Buddhist temple, Takaosan Yakuōin Yūkiji, is located on the mountain, and attracts many visitors who pray to the tengu for good fortune. The temple belongs to the Shingon Buddhist sect.</p>

          <h1>Toyko Food Guide:Top 5 foods that you need to try</h1>
          <h2>1. Sushi</h2>
          <div class="fakeimg7" style="height: 200px"></div>
          <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
           Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</p>
           <h2>2. Yakitori</h2>
           <div class="fakeimg8" style="height: 200px"></div>
           <p>Yakitori (Japanese: 焼き鳥) is a Japanese type of skewered chicken. Its preparation involves skewering the meat with kushi (串), a type of skewer typically made of steel, bamboo, or similar materials. Afterwards, they are grilled over a charcoal fire. During or after cooking, the meat is typically seasoned with tare sauce or salt.The term is sometimes used informally for kushiyaki (grilled and skewered foods) in general.</p>
           <h2>3. Ramen Noodels</h2>
           <div class="fakeimg9" style="height: 200px"></div>
           <p>Ramen (/ˈrɑːmən/) (拉麺, ラーメン rāmen, IPA: [ɾaꜜːmeɴ]) is a Japanese dish with a translation of "pulled noodles". It consists of Chinese wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork (叉焼 chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.</p>
           <h2>4. Okonomiyaki</h2>
           <div class="fakeimg10" style="height: 200px"></div>
           <p>Okonomiyaki is a popular dish in Japan, and people even cook it at home pretty often. At the same time, there are a lot of restaurants that specialize in Okonomiyaki in Tokyo.
            Typically okonomiyaki includes flour, cabbage, scallions, and pork belly slices. It is cooked on a big hot plate and served with a sweet and salty sauce made from soy sauce.</p>
            <h2>5. Soba Noodels</h2>
            <div class="fakeimg11" style="height: 400px"></div>
            <p>Soba (そば or 蕎麦) (/ˈsoʊbə/, Japanese pronunciation: [soba]) is the Japanese name for buckwheat. It usually refers to thin noodles made from buckwheat flour, or a combination of buckwheat and wheat flours (Nagano soba). They contrast to thick wheat noodles, called udon. Soba noodles are served either chilled with a dipping sauce, or in hot broth as a noodle soup.
             In Japan, soba noodles can be found in a variety of settings,from "fast food" places to expensive specialty restaurants. Markets sell dried noodles and men-tsuyu, or instant noodle broth, to make home preparation easy. There are a wide variety of dishes, both hot for winter and cold for summer, using these noodles.
              Soba can nutritionally complement other grains like white rice and wheat flour. Thiamine, missing from white rice, is present in soba. Soba contains all eight essential amino acids, including lysine, which is lacking in wheat flour. The tradition of eating soba arose in the Edo period.</p>
